   - Installed essential dependencies: framer-motion, three.js, @react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei

2. **Data Structure**
   - Created sample motion capture data with simulated walking animation
   - Defined types for motion capture data structure
   - Implemented joint connections for the skeleton visualization

3. **Utility Functions**
   - Implemented interpolation utilities for smooth animation between frames
   - Created functions for position and rotation calculations

4. **Core Components**
   - Built Joint component for visualizing individual joints in 3D space
   - Created Bone component for connecting joints together
   - Developed Skeleton component for combining joints and bones into a full human figure
   - Implemented MotionScene component with Three.js for 3D rendering
   - Added PlaybackControls for animation playback functionality
   - Built JointDetails component for displaying detailed joint information

5. **Main Application**
   - Integrated components into a responsive layout
   - Implemented animation loop with frame interpolation for smooth motion
   - Added interactive joint selection functionality
   - Created UI for joint list, visualization area, and details panel

6. **Styling and UI**
   - Applied TailwindCSS for consistent styling
   - Created a dark-themed interface appropriate for visualization
   - Added responsive layout for different screen sizes

7. **File Upload Functionality**

   - Enhanced with drag-and-drop functionality for seamless file uploads

8. **Playback Control Enhancements**
   - Implemented prominent play/pause controls with visual feedback
   - Added text labels to play/pause buttons for better usability
   - Improved playback speed controls with better visual hierarchy
   - Enhanced UI elements with more distinct visual states
   - Refined spacing and component sizing for better user experience

9. **Position and Movement Controls**
   - Added automatic centering of stick figure on data load
   - Implemented transform controls for moving the stick figure in 3D space
   - Added ability to toggle between translation and rotation modes
   - Created button controls for showing/hiding transform controls
   - Implemented reset position functionality
   - Added front-facing camera reset for better initial viewing
